"When X-rays are scattered from a crystal lattice, peaks of scattered intensity are observed in certain directions determined by the Bragg condition, which relates the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation to the diffraction angle and the lattice spacing in a crystalline sample.",
"Bragg diffraction was first explained by William Lawrence Bragg and his father William Henry Bragg in 1913, for which they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1915 for their services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-rays.",
"Miller indices are a notation system in crystallography for planes in crystal (Bravais) lattices, where the three integers are the inverses of the fractional intercepts the plane makes with the crystallographic axes, cleared of fractions and common multiples.",
"Negative indices are used to indicate a plane that intercepts the negative side of the axis, using a bar over the number to indicate the negative sign, which is the standard notation in crystallography for specifying orientations of planes.",
"X-ray crystallography is a technique used for determining the atomic and molecular structure of a crystal, in which the crystalline atoms cause a beam of incident X-rays to diffract into many specific directions, revealing the structure.",
"In an X-ray diffraction measurement, a crystal is illuminated with X-rays of a known wavelength and the angles and intensities of the diffracted beams are measured, allowing for reconstruction of the electron density within the crystal."
