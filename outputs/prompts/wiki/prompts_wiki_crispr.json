"The CRISPR-associated protein Cas9 is an endonuclease enzyme that uses a guide RNA sequence to cut the DNA, providing a natural defense mechanism in bacteria against viruses by recognizing and cleaving foreign genetic material.",
"Cas9 is widely used in genetic engineering applications where the guide RNA can be designed to match a specific DNA sequence, enabling targeted cuts to introduce changes in the genome, a process known as CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing.",
"A guide RNA (gRNA) is a synthetic RNA composed of a scaffold sequence necessary for Cas9-binding and a user-defined 20 nucleotide spacer that defines the target DNA sequence, guiding Cas9 to the correct cut site.",
"The guide RNA enables sequence-specific binding and cleavage of double-stranded DNA by the Cas9 protein, making it a powerful tool for editing genes at precise locations within complex genomes across a wide variety of organisms."
