        "When X-rays are scattered from a crystal lattice, peaks of scattered intensity are observed in certain directions determined by the Bragg condition, which relates the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation to the diffraction angle and the lattice spacing in a crystalline sample.",
        "Bragg diffraction was first explained by William Lawrence Bragg and his father William Henry Bragg in 1913, for which they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1915 for their services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-rays.",
        "Miller indices are a notation system in crystallography for planes in crystal (Bravais) lattices, where the three integers are the inverses of the fractional intercepts the plane makes with the crystallographic axes, cleared of fractions and common multiples.",
        "Negative indices are used to indicate a plane that intercepts the negative side of the axis, using a bar over the number to indicate the negative sign, which is the standard notation in crystallography for specifying orientations of planes.",
        "X-ray crystallography is a technique used for determining the atomic and molecular structure of a crystal, in which the crystalline atoms cause a beam of incident X-rays to diffract into many specific directions, revealing the structure.",
        "In an X-ray diffraction measurement, a crystal is illuminated with X-rays of a known wavelength and the angles and intensities of the diffracted beams are measured, allowing for reconstruction of the electron density within the crystal.",
        "The CRISPR-associated protein Cas9 is an endonuclease enzyme that uses a guide RNA sequence to cut the DNA, providing a natural defense mechanism in bacteria against viruses by recognizing and cleaving foreign genetic material.",
        "Cas9 is widely used in genetic engineering applications where the guide RNA can be designed to match a specific DNA sequence, enabling targeted cuts to introduce changes in the genome, a process known as CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing.",
        "A guide RNA (gRNA) is a synthetic RNA composed of a scaffold sequence necessary for Cas9-binding and a user-defined 20 nucleotide spacer that defines the target DNA sequence, guiding Cas9 to the correct cut site.",
        "The guide RNA enables sequence-specific binding and cleavage of double-stranded DNA by the Cas9 protein, making it a powerful tool for editing genes at precise locations within complex genomes across a wide variety of organisms.",
        "A Hohmann transfer orbit is an elliptical orbit used to transfer between two circular orbits of different radii around a central body using two engine impulses, minimizing the total amount of propellant needed.",
        "The Hohmann transfer orbit assumes that the initial and final orbits are coplanar and that the impulses are applied instantaneously, making it an efficient method for transferring between orbits under ideal conditions.",
        "In astrodynamics, delta-v, symbolized as Î”v and pronounced delta-vee, is a measure of the impulse needed to perform a maneuver such as launching from, or landing on, a body, or changing orbits.",
        "Delta-v can be regarded as a measure of the amount of effort that is needed to change from one trajectory to another, and in many contexts it can be directly related to fuel consumption.",
        "The apoapsis is the point in the orbit of an object where it is farthest from the body it is orbiting, and the term applies to any orbiting body, not just planets around stars.",
        "Specific terms are used for different central bodies, with 'aphelion' for the Sun, 'apogee' for Earth, and 'apoapsis' being the generic term applicable to orbits around any massive central body in astrodynamics.",
        "The perigee is the point in the orbit of an object where it is closest to the Earth, and it is the opposite of the apogee, the point where the object is farthest from the Earth.",
        "The terms perigee and apogee are often used for satellites orbiting Earth, and they are important for describing the geometry and behavior of satellite orbits in applications such as telecommunications and remote sensing.",
        "A Feynman diagram is a pictorial representation of the mathematical expressions governing the behavior of subatomic particles, showing the interaction of particles over time by lines and vertices according to quantum field theory.",
        "Each line in a Feynman diagram represents a particle, and each vertex represents an interaction between particles, with different types of lines and vertices representing different types of particles and forces according to the rules of the theory."
